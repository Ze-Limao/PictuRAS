PictuRAS is a web app developed as part of the "Requisitos e Arquiteturas de Software" course for the academic year 2024/2025, as a part of the Software Engineering Master's Degree. Its main goal is to provide a powerful and easy to use image editing platform, with support for bulk editing, advanced AI-powered features and user accounts with different subscription levels.

The project used a microservices architecture, with services dedicated to project management, user/session management, tools and a gateway, with whom the frontend communicates.

## ðŸ”¨ Development

### Backend

The set up of all microservices can be set by doing the following:

1. Create a symbolic link to your docker compose (replace `OS` with your operating system):
   ```
   ln -s deployment/OS/docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml
   ```
   Run: 
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Allow direnv inside users and projects:

   ```
   direnv allow .
   ```

3. Copy the environment sample file inside both directories:

   ```
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

4. Reset the database in Phoenix:

   ```
   mix ecto.reset
   ```

5. Start the Phoenix server:

   ```
   mix phx.server
   ```

6. If dependencies are missing, run:
   ```
   mix deps.get
   ```
